## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Wine Quality Dataset
# Edit In Progress !!

## Explanation of the variables:
### Fixed acidity:
Most acids involved with wine or fixed or non-volatile (do not evaporate readily). Acidity is a characteristic determined by the total sum of acids that a sample contains.

### Volatile acidity:
Volatile acidity refers to the steam distillable acids present in wine, primarily acetic acid but also lactic, formic, butyric, and propionic acids

### Residual sugar:
Residual sugar refers to the sugars left unfermented in a finished wine. It is measured by grams of sugar per litre (g/l).

### Chlorides:
The amount of salt in the wine. Red juice should have no more than 356mg/L chloride ions so that finished wine does not exceed the maximum legal level of 606mg/L chloride(356mg/L in red juice x 1.7 = 606).

### Free sulfur dioxide:
The free sulfites are those available to react and thus exhibit both germicidal and antioxidant properties.

### Total sulfur dioxide:
Amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2.

### Density:
The density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content.

### pH:
Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4.

### Sulphates:
A wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial.

Alcohol:
This is the percent alcohol content of the wine.

Quality:
Output variable (based on sensory data, score between 3 and 8).
