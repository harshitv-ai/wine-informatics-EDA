# Explanation of the variables:
#### 1. Fixed acidity:
- Most acids involved with wine or fixed or non-volatile (do not evaporate readily). Acidity is a characteristic determined by the total sum of acids that a sample contains.

#### 2. Volatile acidity:
- Volatile acidity refers to the steam distillable acids present in wine, primarily acetic acid but also lactic, formic, butyric, and propionic acids

#### 3. Residual sugar:
- Residual sugar refers to the sugars left unfermented in a finished wine. It is measured by grams of sugar per litre (g/l).

#### 4. Chlorides:
- The amount of salt in the wine. Red juice should have no more than 356mg/L chloride ions so that finished wine does not exceed the maximum legal level of 606mg/L chloride(356mg/L in red juice x 1.7 = 606).

#### 5. Free sulfur dioxide:
- The free sulfites are those available to react and thus exhibit both germicidal and antioxidant properties.

#### 6. Total sulfur dioxide:
- Amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2.

#### 7. Density:
- The density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content.

#### 8. pH:
- Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4.

#### 9. Sulphates:
- A wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial.

#### 10. Alcohol:
- This is the percent alcohol content of the wine.

#### 11. Quality:
- Output variable (based on sensory data, score between 3 and 8).
  - 3, 4, 5 -> 0 (Bad Quality)
  - 6, 7, 8 -> 1 (Good Quality)
